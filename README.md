# ðŸš€ MLOps Platform

The **MLOps Platform** is designed to enable dynamic and efficient utilization of GPU resources in a cloud-native environment.  
Based on Kubeflow, the platform supports user-customized development environments, on-demand GPU allocation, session preservation, resource scheduling, and more.

## ðŸ§© System Architecture

> ðŸ“Œ Detailed architecture documentation is in progress. Below is a high-level user flow.

- **User Flow**
  1. Connect via VPN
  2. Select development environment (e.g., Jupyter + PyTorch)
  3. Launch containerized environment
  4. Perform GPU-accelerated tasks
  5. Automatically return resources and save session upon exit

- **Admin Features**
  - Register and manage environment images
  - Control permissions and monitor resource usage
  - Automate user registration and access control

## ðŸ§­ Roadmap

**Phase 1: Core Service Setup (May, Weeks 2â€“4)**  
- Setup Kubeflow-based notebook environments *(Completed)*  
- Implement Namespace and RBAC-based user isolation *(Completed)*  
- Draft UI for development environment selection *(In progress)*  

**Phase 2: Dynamic GPU Allocation & Session Restoration (May Week 5 â€“ June Week 1)**  
- Implement GPU on-demand allocation and auto-deallocation  
- Develop session saving and restoration features  
- Integrate ML framework/version selection into UI  

**Phase 3: Resource Scheduling & Sharing (June Weeks 1â€“3)**  
- Introduce priority-based GPU scheduling policies (e.g., Kueue)  
- Apply CUDA MPS for GPU sharing among users  
- Set user-specific resource limits and concurrency control  

**Phase 4: Monitoring & Operational Automation (June Weeks 3â€“5)**  
- Build a system/resource monitoring dashboard using Grafana + Prometheus + DCGM Exporter  
- Develop anomaly detection and user alert system (e.g., Slack/Email)  
- Provide an admin-only dashboard with usage statistics and historical data
